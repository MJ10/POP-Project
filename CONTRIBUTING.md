## Guidelines
* Avoid using random variable names. Try using meaningful names for variables.
* Add JavaDoc for each function you define, detailing the input parameters and the value being returned.
* As far as possible, try abstracting as much detail as possible. for eg. define getter functions instead of directly accessing values from a class.
